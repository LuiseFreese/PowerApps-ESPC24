## Creat a Form in MS Forms for participant registration
In this exercise we will create a Form in MS Forms where the participants will see the different workshops and can select one workshop. We will use the fact, that the participant is logged into M365 and we can automatically submit their identity through forms.

## Create new form
Navigate to [MS Forms](https://forms.office.com/)

Select "New Form"

Use `Participant workshop registration` as your title and select `Quick start with` and select `Choice`.

Add `Which Workshop would you like to attend?` as the title of the question and use the *exact* titles of your workshops from earlier as potential answers (in my case `Workshop A`, `Workshop B` and `Workshop C`)
